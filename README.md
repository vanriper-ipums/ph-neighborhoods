# ph-neighborhoods
This repository contains code used to create plots for the public housing neighborhood paper
that Ryan Allen, Catalina Anampa Castro, Corissa Marson, and I are writing. This paper is 
based on work done during the 2019 MPC Summer Diversity Fellowship and subsequent work
during AY2019-20.

## TODO list
- [] Map of cities in dataset - appendix?
- [] Illustrative example of scanned ED map showing ED of PH project and neighboring EDs
- [X] Neighborhood population (for each project) - total pop, white/black - appendix?
- [X] Public housing project population count and HH count - appendix? working on this now
- [] Inspect the public housing household counts to make sure they match prior counts (I'm worried about the serial issues)
- [X] Median HH income plots (by race or region)
